# Zeus Be Kind. A weather APP designed with skaters in mind.
## Zeus Be Kind is a skate weather app that looks to see if there will be 
## any point during the day that skating will be possible.
### Details: Favorable conditions are determined via no rain in the forecast,
### no rain (under a 40% chance) scheduled in the next 3 hours, or if it has rained,
### Zeus Be Kind figured out if the streets will be dry enough to skate.
